## Go GXPlatform

Official golang implementation of the GXPlatform protocol.

## Building the source

Building geth requires both a Go (version 1.7 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make gxp

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

    make all

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`gxp`** | Our main GXP CLI client. It is the entry point into the GXP network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default) archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `gxp --help`|

## Running gxp

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here, but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Geth instance.

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```
$ gxp console
```

This command will:

 * Start geth in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to
   download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Ethereum network,
   which is very CPU intensive.

### Full node on the Ethereum test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum contracts, you
almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the
entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main network, you want to join the **test**
network with your node, which is fully equivalent to the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```
$ gxp --testnet console
```

The `console` subcommand have the exact same meaning as above and they are equally useful on the
testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you've skipped to here.

Specifying the `--testnet` flag however will reconfigure your Geth instance a bit:

 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), Geth will nest
   itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/testnet` on Linux). Note, on OSX
   and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom
   endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default. E.g.
   `geth attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by this.
 * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test network,
   which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.
   
*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing
over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always use separate accounts
for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move accounts, Geth will by default correctly
separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them.*

```

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `gxp` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```
$ gxp --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to export your existing configuration:

```
$ gxp --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```


Do not forget `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers and/or hosts. By default, `gxp` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints is not accessible from the outside.

### Programatically interfacing GXP nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with GXP and the GXPlatform
network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid this, GXP has built-in
support for a JSON-RPC based APIs. These can be
exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (unix sockets on unix based platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by GXP, whereas the HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of APIs due to security reasons.
These can be turned on/off and configured as you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)
  * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: "gxp,net,web3")
  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: 8546)
  * `--wsapi` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: "gxp,net,web3")
  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: "admin,eth,miner,net,personal,txpool,web3")
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to connect
via HTTP, WS or IPC to a Geth node configured with the above flags and you'll need to speak [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
on all transports. You can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for granted in
the official networks need to be manually set up.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be aware of
and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
        "chainId": 0,
        "homesteadBlock": 0
    },
  "alloc"      : {},
  "coinbase"   : "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty" : "0x20000",
  "extraData"  : "",
  "gasLimit"   : "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce"      : "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash"    : "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash" : "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp"  : "0x00"
}
```

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing the `nonce` to
some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able to connect to you. If you'd
like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, you can populate the `alloc` field with account
configs:

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {"balance": "111111111"},
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {"balance": "222222222"}
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every** Geth node
with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly set:

```
$ gxp init path/to/genesis.json
```
